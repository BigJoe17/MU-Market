# Fix Profile Update Error

## Problem Diagnosis
The "Error updating profile. Please try again." message occurs because the database schema is incomplete. The profile edit page is trying to update columns that don't exist in the current `users` table.

## Root Cause
The basic `supabase-schema.sql` was applied, but the `enhanced-schema.sql` (which adds the required profile columns) hasn't been run yet.

## Missing Database Columns
The profile update requires these columns in the `users` table:
- `department` (TEXT)
- `bio` (TEXT) 
- `profile_image_url` (TEXT)
- `is_premium` (BOOLEAN)
- `premium_expires_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- `total_sales` (INTEGER)
- `rating_average` (DECIMAL)
- `rating_count` (INTEGER)
- `last_active` (TIMESTAMP)

## Missing Storage Configuration
The profile image upload requires:
- `profiles` storage bucket
- Proper RLS policies for the profiles bucket

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Apply Enhanced Database Schema
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `enhanced-schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL commands

### Step 2: Verify Database Structure
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify the columns exist:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY column_name;
```

### Step 3: Verify Storage Bucket
1. Go to Storage in Supabase dashboard
2. Verify the `profiles` bucket exists
3. Check that RLS policies are set up correctly

### Step 4: Test Profile Update
1. Try updating your profile again
2. The error should be resolved

## Alternative Quick Fix
If you can't apply the enhanced schema immediately, you can modify the profile edit page to only update the existing columns (`name`, `email`) and disable the department, bio, and profile image features temporarily.

## Technical Details
- The error occurs in the `updateUserProfile` function in `lib/utils.ts`
- Supabase throws an error when trying to update non-existent columns
- The error is caught and shows the generic "Error updating profile" message
